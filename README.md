# Hi there 👋

I like code, [StarCraft](https://starcraft2.com/en-us/profile/1/1/724361), [Control](https://www.remedygames.com/games/control/), swing dancing (lindy hop and collegiate shag are my favorites), coffee, spicy food, and games with friends.

Floating window managers (MacOS, Windows) are suboptimal for me.
MacOS, in particular, is really bad, and even all the paid tiling software doesn't do what https://i3wm.org/ does
